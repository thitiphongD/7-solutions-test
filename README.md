# Next.js Todo Application

This project is a Todo application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) that demonstrates two main features:

## Project Assignments

### 1. Auto Delete Todo List

The application features a Todo list with an automatic deletion feature that removes todos after a specified time period. Users can view all items, or filter by categories (fruits and vegetables).

### 2. Create Data from API

The application fetches and displays data from external APIs

## Live Demo

The application is deployed and available at: [https://7-solutions-test-five.vercel.app/](https://7-solutions-test-five.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
